# Minecraft Server

A Minecraft Server implementation that supports modern Minecraft versions. It is written in TypeScript and Deno. I aim to keep it as minimal as possible and implement the minimum for survival gameplay.

## Getting started

- Install [Deno](https://deno.land)
- Download [sources](https://github.com/janispritzkau/deno-minecraft-server/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clone [repository](https://github.com/janispritzkau/deno-minecraft-server.git)

### Run server

```
deno run --allow-net src/main.ts
```

### Run tests

```
deno test
```
